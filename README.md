**ROSSMAN RETAIL STORE REGRESSION ANALYSIS**

**Introduction:**

The Rossman retail store regression analysis project aims to predict the daily sales of different retail stores using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as promotions, holidays, and store information, the project seeks to build a robust model that accurately predicts sales. The project utilizes multiple algorithms and evaluates their performance to identify the best model for the task. Additionally, the project explores feature importance and interprets the model to gain insights into the key drivers of daily sales.

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to predict the daily sales of Rossmann retail stores by applying machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the provided dataset and leveraging features such as promotions, holidays, and store information, the project aims to develop a model capable of accurately predicting sales. The project also seeks to interpret the model's predictions and identify the most influential features that impact daily sales.

**Data Summary:**

The dataset used in this project contains information about 1,115 Rossmann retail stores across different countries. It includes data on daily sales, promotional activities, holidays, and store-specific information. The dataset consists of 1,017,209 observations and 18 features that describe each store's daily sales. Features such as store type, day of the week, promotional offers, state holidays, assortment size, competition distance, and more are included in the dataset.

**Approach:**

The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. EDA involves examining the distribution of the target variable (daily sales) and exploring the relationships between the target variable and the different features. Visualization techniques are used to identify outliers, missing values, and other anomalies in the data.

Next, feature selection and engineering techniques are employed to identify the most significant features that impact daily sales. This process involves creating new features by combining or transforming existing ones, as well as handling missing values and converting categorical features into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding.

Following feature selection and engineering, several machine learning models are trained and evaluated using different algorithms. Baseline models such as Ridge regression and Lasso regression are employed, along with more complex models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score are used to assess model performance.

After comparing the performance of different models, the Gradient Boosting Regressor is selected as the best model for the prediction task, achieving an R2 score of 0.93 on the test dataset. This model is then used to generate sales predictions for the test dataset, which are compared to the actual sales figures.

Furthermore, the project employs the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainability tool to interpret the Gradient Boosting Regressor model and understand the feature importance. SHAP values provide insights into how each feature contributes to the model's output, allowing for the identification of the most influential features impacting daily sales.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the Rossman retail store regression analysis project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to predict daily sales. By analyzing various features and employing techniques such as EDA, feature selection and engineering, and model evaluation, the project provides accurate sales predictions. The interpretation of the model using the SHAP explainability tool offers insights into the key drivers of daily sales. The project's findings can assist retail store owners in optimizing their operations, making data-driven decisions, and improving sales performance.
